# Halo 3 Modding

### Currently a dumping ground for different Halo 3 modding tests I am running.


### Levels are stored in a way where they will not load off the bat if you were to download the files. You need to take the tags (.scenario file) and move it to your H3EK tags level folder, and then you need to move the scripts to your H3EK data level folder. See the paths below.

- ${path_to_editing_kit}\H3EK\tags\levels
- ${path_to_editing_kit}\H3EK\data\levels
